								<h3>Which approach to theory building and measurement do you prefer?</h3>
								<p style="text-align:justify">Psychologists refer to themselves as being quantitative 
								or qualitative researchers. When attempting to define psychological constructs, the 
								quantitative approach usually builds questionnaires based on experts' understanding of 
								the construct, which are then validated through factor analyses and correlational studies. 
								On the other hand, the qualitative approach includes interviews or other forms of text 
								collection and in-depth thematic analyses.</p>

								<header style="text-align:center">
								    <p>Both the quantitative and qualitative approach have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
							        </header>

								<p style="text-align:justify">Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Especially, 
								the quantitative approach is structured, but questionnaires are noisy and experts' definitions of 
								constructs might be incomplete. The qualitative approach uses rich data, but lacks transparency, 
								replicability and generalisability.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>A hybrid approach to theory building: The Construct Mining Pipeline</h3>
								<p style="text-align:justify">We introduce the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/s64tm">Construct Mining Pipeline</a> 
								to infer the structure of psychological constructs. It is supposed to combine advantages and mitigate disadvantages 
								of both the quantitative and qualitative approach. It builds on semi-structured text data and uses structured data 
								processing methods from computer science to provide greater transparency, replicability and scalability, 
								while preserving the richness of text data.</p>

								<header style="text-align:center">
								    <p>The Construct Mining Pipeline involves nine steps.</p>
							        </header>

								<p style="text-align:justify">Feel free to explore the Construct Mining Pipeline in short through the illustration below. 
								For more detail, please refer to our <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/s64tm">preprint</a> or try it out using our 
								<a href="https://github.com/Hai-Lina/construct-mining-pipeline">repository.</a></p>

								<h3>Demonstrating the pipeline: What emotion regulation strategies are there?</h3>
								<p style="text-align:justify">Over the past 20 years research has accumulated considerable 
								knowledge on a multitude of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 
								terms of their effects on psychological health, overall well-being 
								and social functioning. Experiments provided evidence for generally 
								beneficial or harmful strategies. Questionnaires to assess 
								emotion regulation have been developed. Plus, there is some very 
								well acknowledged theory.</p>
								<header style="text-align:center">
								    <p>Nobody ever asked what emotion regulation strategies are actually existing.</p>
							        </header>								
								<p style="text-align:justify">Despite all evidence on ER strategies, we still don't know what 
								<i>exactly</i> constitutes successful emotion regulation. This is partly due 
								to a fragmented understanding of the overall ER strategy pool. In 
								experiments some strategies are overstudied, while some are neglected. 
								Questionnaires often seem to cover an arbitrary number of strategies. 
								And theories are usually too broad in order to be informative for 
								the prediction of outcome variables.</p>
								<header style="text-align:center">
								    <p>In this application, we derive an ER strategy classification system from 
								    descriptions of people's actual ER attempts.</p>
							       </header>
								
								<hr />
								
								<h3>A more ecologically valid measure of emotion regulation behavior</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ERSIT.png" alt="" style="width:90%"/></span></p>
								<p style="text-align:justify">By nature, it is hard to measure ER attempts, because they happen 
								constantly and cannot necessarily be observed. Experience sampling 
								is expensive and restricts participants in their answers. Instead 
								our method is based on textual data, a dataset that consists of 
								sentences, each sentence describing one emotion regulation strategy 
								(for example: <i>I call a friend and ask for help.</i>).</p>
								<header style="text-align:center">
								    <p>What would you do to make yourself feel better?</p>
                                				</header>
				                                <p style="text-align:justify">In order to obtain these strategy 
				                                descriptions, we are asking people to imagine being in an emotional 
				                                situation and write down as many ideas as possible to make themselves 
				                                feel better in a limited amount of time. See the picture on the left 
				                                for an example item of the questionnaire.</p>
								
								<hr />
								
								<h3>Deriving strategy classes using the Construct Mining Pipeline</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ER.png" alt="" style="width:70%" /></span></p>
								<p>We use a pipeline of sentence embeddings, dimension reduction and 
								clustering algorithms to obtain a landscape of emotion regulation 
								strategies (see image on the right). Similar strategy descriptions 
								are grouped together in the sentence embedding space making up a strategy cluster. The 
								taxonomy is validated with robustness checks and a human-in-the-loop approach.
